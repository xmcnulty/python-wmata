        train_id (str): Uniquely identifiable internal train identifier.
        train_number (str): Non-unique train identifier, often used by WMATA's Rail Scheduling and Operations Teams, as well as over open radio communication.
        car_count (int): Number of cars in the train. 0 when no data available.
        direction_num (int): The direction of movement regardless of which track the train is on. Valid values are 1 or 2. Generally speaking, trains with direction 1 are northbound/eastbound, while trains with direction 2 are southbound/westbound.
        circuit_id (int): Track circuit identifier where the train is currently located.
        seconds_at_location (int): Number of seconds the train has been at its current location.
        service_type (ServiceType): Type of service the train is providing (e.g., Normal, Special).
        destination_station_code (Optional[str]): Station code of the trainâ€™s final destination. Can be None.
        line_code (Optional[str]): Line code (e.g., 'RD' for Red Line). Can be None.
